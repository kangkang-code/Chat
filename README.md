In Qt, the button is directly generated by UI, and the code is mainly divided into three parts, dialoglist.cpp,main.cpp, and widget.cpp. Dialoglist mainly writes the signal slot function. Widgets are used to bind port numbers and ancillary features such as font size, font color, chat record save path, and so on.
